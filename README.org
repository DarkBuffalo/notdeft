/NotDeft/ is a spin-off of [[https://jblevins.org/projects/deft/][Deft]], an “Emacs mode for quickly browsing, filtering, and editing directories of plain text notes.” NotDeft retains functionality similar to Deft's, albeit with less configurability. In addition, NotDeft features efficient, local, [[https://xapian.org/][Xapian]]-engine-based free-text search over potentially very large numbers of note files; in that respect it is like the [[https://notmuchmail.org/][Notmuch]] Emacs mode for managing email.

NotDeft is not as deft in note management as Deft. One reason for this is that NotDeft is designed to support managing of multiple directories of notes. Another complication is that locating the desired notes is a two-stage process, as it entails both searching for a set of notes by entering a query, and then further narrowing down the result set through interactive filtering.

NotDeft does not aim for the user interaction simplicity of applications like Deft and Notational Velocity---instead, it intends to provide global note search and manipulation functionality, accessible from various Emacs buffers and Emacs-based applications.

* Quick Start

Download the source code with
: git clone https://github.com/hasu/notdeft.git

Then byte-compile the Emacs Lisp files with the commands
: cd notdeft
: make
where =make= is assumed to invoke GNU Make.

Then build the Xapian backend by doing
: cd xapian
: make
If the =make= command fails, then you will need to ensure that you have the required libraries installed, and find the right C++ compiler incantation for building the =notdeft-xapian= program on your system.

To your Emacs startup file (e.g., “~/.emacs”), add
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/your/installation/of/notdeft")
  (setq notdeft-xapian-program
	"/your/installation/of/notdeft/xapian/notdeft-xapian")
  (require 'notdeft-autoloads)
#+END_SRC

Create a “~/.deft/” directory, and copy some “.org” files there. To arrange to enable =notdeft-note-mode= minor mode for those files, also create a “~/.deft/.dir-locals.el” file containing
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
((org-mode . ((mode . org)
              (mode . notdeft-note))))
#+END_SRC

Launch Emacs with
: emacs -f notdeft
and press =TAB= to enter a search query (or =S-TAB= to clear it), and then type characters to do further filtering of the results. Input =C-c f1= to see other available commands.

For other ways to install, configure, and use NotDeft, see the [[http://tero.hasu.is/notdeft/][documentation]].
