;;; Commentary:
;; A hydra for some of NotDeft's globally usable commands; intended to
;; be “helpful” without much support for command chaining. Defines the
;; command `notdeft-global-hydra/body', and adds the hydra bindings to
;; an internal keymap. The `notdeft-global-hydra/body' command can be
;; bound as desired to access the commands with short key sequences
;; and textual hints in the Hydra command group context. It makes
;; available roughly the same bindings as in `notdeft-global-map', but
;; in a different way.
;;
;; To bind the hydra, one can for example:
;;   (autoload 'notdeft-global-hydra/body "notdeft-global-hydra" nil t)
;;   (global-set-key [f6] 'notdeft-global-hydra/body)
;;
;; This feature will define nothing unless the `hydra' feature is
;; available.

(require 'hydra nil t)
